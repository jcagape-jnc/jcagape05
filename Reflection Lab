## 📝 Branding Reflection

My personal branding, AXYON, was inspired by my own journey of growth and the constant push to improve myself, both academically and creatively. 
The phrase “Advancing What’s Next” reflects how I see my work and goals always moving forward and preparing for the next challenge instead of staying comfortable. 
I chose the red and pink tones because they represent energy, passion, and confidence, while the lighter and neutral colors help balance everything so it still feels professional and clean.
One of the hardest parts of creating the branding was turning my ideas into a logo that actually represents movement and progress without making it look too complicated. 
There were moments where I had to revise and rethink the design until it finally felt right and truly reflected me. In the future, 
I plan to use this branding consistently in my GitHub profile, projects, and presentations so people can easily recognize my work and associate it with growth and innovation.
