## 🎨 Design Reflection

The design principle I found most useful was **contrast**, especially using a dark background with light text and accent colors because it made the important information stand out clearly.  

In Canva, the easiest part was arranging text and images since the templates already guide you on alignment. However, the hardest part was deciding what to keep simple and what to remove so the slides wouldn’t look crowded.  

I struggled a bit with spacing and consistency at first, but adjusting fonts and layouts helped everything feel more balanced. This activity taught me that visual communication is not about adding more elements, but about choosing the right ones that support the message.  

Overall, I learned that a clean and focused design makes a presentation more engaging and easier to understand.
