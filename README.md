## 📝 Branding Reflection

My branding was inspired by my interest in clean, modern, and forward-thinking design that represents growth and innovation. The AXYON logo uses a bold letter “A” combined with flowing shapes to symbolize progress, creativity, and continuous movement. I chose a strong color palette to create contrast and make the brand visually striking while maintaining a professional look. One of the most challenging parts of creating the logo was keeping it simple while still making it meaningful and unique. I had to remove unnecessary elements so the logo would remain clear and recognizable at any size. In the future, I plan to use this branding system across my GitHub profile, academic projects, and personal portfolio to maintain a consistent visual identity.
